# HCI Project - Paradise With A View Redesign

Paradise with a view is a hotel, lodge and property renting website. The original implementation of the website doesn't adhere to web-design standards.
Information collected from the webarchive(Paradise With a View is no longer running) shows the design of the whole website doesnâ€™t invite users for engagement.
The main goal is to create a mobile friendly, responsive website. Certain screen design patterns for better information conveyance will be implemented. Clear and concise navigation with a structured hierarchy of contents will be developed. 

This repository is part of a Human-Computer Interaction UI Project.
